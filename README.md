1st way:
Download the .rar (or .zip) file named 'Source_Code' end export into a directory of choice . 
Run the .py file named Our_App.py and choose if you want to run the App with fake data or a full database . The choice will be made through the terminal before launching the GUI , you will be asked inside the terminal .
After you choose, the db will be created and you will not be asked again (if you run the app a second time). If you change your mind you can delete the .db file that will have been created and run again the app, then you will be prompted again.
